# CSS Instagram Homework

In module 1 at General Assembly, we explored HTML, CSS, Flexbox and Javascript. For this particular homework, we were tasked to replicate the Instagram homepage in desktop format and if we had time, to also explore responsive design for mobile and other devices. 

With little experience using flexbox, this was my attempt after spending 2 hours that same evening:

I was proud of what I had achieved, but also felt rather disheartened at myself for not being able to complete the desktop version in time.   


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Use all of your CSS knowledge to position elements on the page.
- Design your site mobile-first (start with mobile, then use media queries to change the design for desktop).

```
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
```

- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The phones
  - App Store and Google Play links
  - Instagram logo


#### Deliverable

#### Bonus: Font Awesome

There is a great resource for icons like the Facebook icon on the log in button, called [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). If you are interested, have a look at the 'Get Started' section, and add the [Facebook icon](http://fontawesome.io/icon/facebook-official/) to the button.
